collaboration with Tom Winder, Johan den Dunnen. The reference
sequence was derived from AL645608.30.
This sequence is a reference standard in the RefSeqGene project.
Summary: This gene encodes one of several proteins that are
critical in the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), as
identified in mouse knock-out studies. The encoded protein contains
several laminin G, Kazal type serine protease inhibitor, and
epidermal growth factor domains. Additional post-translational
modifications occur to add glycosaminoglycans and disulfide bonds.
In one family with congenital myasthenic syndrome affecting
limb-girdle muscles, a mutation in this gene was found. Alternative
splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different
isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2015].",Homo sapiens,DNA,linear

Summary: This gene encodes an A20-binding protein which plays a
role in autoimmunity and tissue homeostasis through the regulation
of nuclear factor kappa-B activation. Mutations in this gene have
been associated with psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and
systemic lupus erythematosus. Multiple transcript variants encoding
different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by

HAVCR2,NG_030444,30406,"Homo sapiens hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (HAVCR2), RefSeqGene on chromosome 5","REVIEWED REFSEQ: This record has been curated by NCBI staff. The
reference sequence was derived from AC011377.6.
This sequence is a reference standard in the RefSeqGene project.
Summary: The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the
immunoglobulin superfamily, and TIM family of proteins.
CD4-positive T helper lymphocytes can be divided into types 1 (Th1)
and 2 (Th2) on the basis of their cytokine secretion patterns. Th1
cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity to intracellular
pathogens and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, whereas, Th2
cells are involved in the control of extracellular helminthic
infections and the promotion of atopic and allergic diseases. This
protein is a Th1-specific cell surface protein that regulates
macrophage activation, and inhibits Th1-mediated auto- and
alloimmune responses, and promotes immunological tolerance.

Summary: Granulins are a family of secreted, glycosylated peptides
that are cleaved from a single precursor protein with 7.5 repeats
of a highly conserved 12-cysteine granulin/epithelin motif. The 88
kDa precursor protein, progranulin, is also called proepithelin and
PC cell-derived growth factor. Cleavage of the signal peptide
produces mature granulin which can be further cleaved into a
variety of active, 6 kDa peptides. These smaller cleavage products
are named granulin A, granulin B, granulin C, etc. Epithelins 1 and
2 are synonymous with granulins A and B, respectively. Both the
peptides and intact granulin protein regulate cell growth. However,
different members of the granulin protein family may act as
inhibitors, stimulators, or have dual actions on cell growth.
Granulin family members are important in normal development, wound
healing, and tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].",Homo sapiens,DNA,linear
